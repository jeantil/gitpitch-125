## gitpich is awesome

---
@title[working title]
## it has working titles

---

@title[working title 2]

## it is GFM compliant

---
@title[it has code higlight]
## it has code higlight

```scala
object GitPitch{
  val IsAwesome=true
}
```
+++

But you can't quote it's own markup in code blocks

```markdown
 ---
 @title[it has code higlight]
 ## it has code higlight
 
 ```scala
 object GitPitch{
   val IsAwesome=true
 }
 ``

```

To make the code display properly I had to :
- put a non breaking space at each start of lines 
- drop the last ` on the closing quoted code block

@title[it has broken code higlight]

## it has broken code higlight

```scala
object GitPitch{
  val IsAwesome=true
}
```
+++

```markdown
 ---
 
 @title[it has broken code higlight]
 ## it has broken code higlight
 
 ```scala
 object GitPitch{
   val IsAwesome=true
 }
 ``

```

To make the code display properly I had to :
- put a non breaking space at each start of lines 
- drop the last ` on the closing quoted code block

The difference with working sample is the line break between the slide marker and the @title.

@title[it has sublists]
## is has nested lists

* item 1
  * item 2
  * item 3
* item 1
  * item 2
  * item 3

---

@title[it has broken sublists]
## it has broken  markdown

if you skip a line between the custom title, the markdown renderer is unahppy and treats double spaces as a line break.

* item 1
  * item 2
  * item 3
* item 1
  * item 2
  * item 3

 * item 1

* the non breaking space trick again 
* the line between slide marker and @title again
